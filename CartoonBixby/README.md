# Bixby Capsule to for Cartoons

With this capsule users of Bixby will be able to find a lot of cartoons from the world's largest cartoons website

## Getting Started

This playground was explained in the YouTube video "Coding with Adam: Build a Bixby Capsule in Under An Hour"
This is the good introduction to the Bixby development, I would personally recommend taking before getting your hands dirty with the next and possibly the most promising AI assistant. To be able to run and modify the playground you will need to install Bixby Developer Studio.

### Installing

Install Bixby Developer Studio from the link below:
https://bixbydevelopers.com/

Clone this repository

```
git clone thisRepoName
```

Launch the Bixby Developer Studio

Click File -> Open Capsule

Navigate to the cloned repo folder and click "Open"

In the files tree navigate to resources -> en and open the file named "training"

Click "Compile NL Model"

In the left bar click on the "Simulator"

In the opened window of a simulator click "Run NL"

Now you can type in some search cartoons commands such as "find cartoons about dogs"
